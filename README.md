# Recommendation-Engine
In this project I have built a "Movie Recommendation System" using the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm that will help recommend movies to users to enhance customer satisfaction and content consumption. These recommendation systems are generally used for marketing purpose or increase the sales of a perticular commodity hassle free while being budget-conscious.
This model can be easily integrated to the backend of any kind of online streaming or OTT platform with a slight bit of fine tuning.
